VBA Repo of Code Modules to help in real world scenarios

Code Modules:
Excel_OnTime - Application.OnTime is super helpful vba tool to help schedule procedures in the future or rerun procedures based on the given time. 
If you have a task that needs to be run at a certain time each day this can be really helpful. 

Windows_SetTimer - A Windows API to the SetTimer function which is similar to vba's Application.OnTime. Also included is SetThreadExecutionState which 
stops your computer from going to sleep. If asleep, both OnTime and SetTimer will not function properly any longer. 

More to come soon!
